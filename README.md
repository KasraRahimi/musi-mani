# musi mani
This is an open source Discord bot project. The bot is intended to host a number of casino games that players can place bets. This project is being developped using the Interactions.py library for creating bots on Discord.
## Setting Up
If you'd like to set up your own version of this bot, there are a couple of steps you'd have to take. I recommend setting up a virtual environment to keep all the packages associated with this bot neat and tidy.

You can take the following steps to get the project running.
```
git clone https://github.com/KasraRahimi/musi-mani.git
cd musi-mani
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
To run the bot, you will have to configure the environment variables. An example configuration file (`.env.example`) is included in the repository. Duplicate this file, rename it to a `.env`, and replace the placeholder values with your own.
